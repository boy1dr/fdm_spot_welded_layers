Testing an idea of spot welding layers together for added strength

Appears to add about 20% extra strength but more testing is required to know exactly how much.

Had a little problem calculating the extrusion volume so the flowrate adjustment was added to get it close to correct.

Youtube vdeo to follow shortly.

Please use caution as this is an experimental process. It works perfectly for me on an i3 clone 3d printer with repetier firmware.
